##### Can I Play Electronics?

If you have kids, you **must** be tired of that question!  This is an attempt to prevent the question *and* get my kids to look around and recognize (and do!) some of the almost daily chores that need done.

It's not perfect, but it has made a big improvement and lowered the tension around electronics use.

I welcome suggestions.

There are three file types, but they are all the same "version":
* **.PDF** -- Most compatible format for you to print.  Not *really* editable.
* **.ODG** -- Open Document format created in [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org) Draw.
* **.SVG** -- Text-based graphics format that *could* be modified via script (or by hand) to make minor text changes (like the number of hours or chores).

It prints/looks best on legal-sized paper.
